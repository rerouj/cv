Dear recruiters,

Please find below my updated cv with all the details about my professional situation. Word files are boring: cvs need many updates and sometimes it's hard to keep control over the numerous file versions produced for the recruiters. With Github that's possible so this is where I will "push" my professional updates from now on.

### About me

My main goal is to keep learning and evolve in the industry as a devoloper to the level of senior by the end of 2023. In my daily work, two things matters : results, value and friendly teamwork.
