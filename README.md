# A README.md as a resume

Dear recruiters,

Please find below my updated cv with all the details about my professional situation. Word files are boring: cvs need many updates and sometimes it's hard to keep control over the numerous file versions produced for the recruiters. With Github that's possible so this is where I will push my professional updates from now on.
